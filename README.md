# BlazorApp1
This is my first experience with Blazor. I implemented part of my Audio Flashcards Angular app as a Blazor app. The recording
screen shows the list of existing recordings but has no playback or recording funtionality. The playback page plays recordings and reschedules
the prompts client-side. No writes are done to the server as this is experimental.
